# bubble-source
Shaun Harker

This is a project to produce d3 bubble-visualizations of code source. The technique is to parse the XML output of Doxygen. Clicking on the bubbles results in source code listings. It is currently functional with C++ (though rather lightly tested).

Documentation and an example can be found at
