== Overview

This is a tool to use http://www.doxygen.org[Doxygen]-generated XML files to produce a http://d3js.org[d3] bubble-visualization of the source code. Clicking on the bubbles results in a code listing. Here is an example:

<iframe 
  id="frame" 
  src="http://math.rutgers.edu/~sharker/DSGRN/ViewSource/index.html"
  width="100%"
  height="700" 
  scrolling="no">
</iframe>
++++

== Usage

First ensure you have the dependencies. These are Boost and Doxygen. On Mac OS X, these can be acquired with 
```bash
brew install boost
brew install doxygen
```

Next compile the software

```bash
./install.sh
```

This creates a single executable and places it in the `bin` folder in the source (not in the system).

Now generate the web-page:

```bash
./makesite PROJECT AUTHOR DATE SOURCEFOLDER SOURCEURL EXCLUDE
```

The six arguments here are respectively

* The name of the project

* The name of the author

* The date you'd like to go on the web page

* The folder where doxygen should look for your source

* The URL where the web site should find your code for the listings

* Globbing expressions to exclude certain source files from being noticed by doxygen

If arguments have spaces in them, then surround them with ' characters.

The files for the webpage are now available at
```bash
site/index.html
site/programdata.json
```
to wherever you want to display this page. Note that the source code needs to be available at `SOURCEURL` on the web as well.

== Notes

I should have written this without using Boost. And made more options. Etcetera. Source contributions are most welcome.
